makehackvoid.com
================

This project maintains the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) layouts, stylesheets, and other assets required to automatically build the [makehackvoid.com](http://makehackvoid.com) website.

Usage
-----

We build the website automatically from plaintext [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. This means adding your content is quite simple, with two options for doing so:

1. directly via GitHub’s web interface; or
2. by downloading the project for editing locally

For more detail see the [howto for writing/adding content on the MHV blog](http://makehackvoid.com/blog/2014/03/15/writing-howto/).

To hack on the website you’ll need [Ruby and Ruby Gems](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). To fetch the necessary packages/dependencies use bundle, in the root of the project:

    bundle install

You may need to install some dependencies too (if you don’t already have them):

    sudo gem install jekyll-assets
    sudo gem install sass
    sudo gem install uglifier

and then build the site locally while watching for changes:

    jekyll serve --watch

File structure
--------------

- `news/_posts/`: news items (blog)
- `events/_posts/`: event postings (blog)
- `projects/_posts/`: project exhibition

- `_data`: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/
