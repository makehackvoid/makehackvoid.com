* **Annual Membership**
* **Access** Members pay monthly or per visit access for their use of the MHV space.
* **Voissoir** People who have a key to open the MHV space for themselves and other members.

# How to become a Member

Joining is really easy - just show up at the space some time when it is open!

* **Step One** - Fill in the membership form  [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yu7iUOJPQHefiLgDue3oAbMBu-4s87f_tygPlz5Isw0/viewform)

* **Step Two** - Check out [the rules](http://wiki.makehackvoid.com/policy:rules_draft) of the Makerspace (including conditions of membership) and make sure that you agree to abide by them. That’s important for everyone’s safety and enjoyment.

* **Step Three** - Bank transfer your annual membership payment (and initial access payment if you are going to come other times than the [Maker Meetups](/meetings) which are gold coin donation) to:

    + Name: Make Hack Void Inc
    + BSB : 012951
    + Account No: 250992065

    Use your full name as the payment description.

    The MHV account is with the ANZ Bank.

* **Step Four** - If you can, use internet banking to set up a schedule for your future payments. At the moment, that’s the best way to keep your membership current.

* **Step Five** - Congratulate yourself on your new Makerspace membership.

* **Step Six** - Get down to the space and hack on stuff!

# How to become a Space Opener

You only <i>need</i> to become a Space Opener if you want your own key to the space and want to help the community by opening the space. Space Openers have a key and can access the space whenever they want. They are also responsible for opening the space for other members and announcing when they will open the space on the makers mailing list and in the MHV Calendar.


* **Step One** - Sign up for an membership and get involved in the community:
    + Come along to the space, including to Maker Meetups.
    + Help other Makers with their projects.
    + Volunteer to help out when you can.
    + Be a power for awesome in the community.

* **Step Two** - Once you've been involved with the space for a while, you'll need to be nominated by another Space Opening member and then have that nomination seconded by two more members.

* The nominators &amp; seconders much vouch that you:
    + Are familiar with the space
    + Regularly attend
    + Have met the majority of regular attendees
    + Are trustworthy
    + Are familiar with Make, Hack, Void's rules, lore and customs.

* **Step Three** - Once this is recorded at a committee meeting or on the committee mailing list, you become eligible (yay!)

* **Step Four** - The person who nominated you, and the seconders, are responsible for inducting you as a Space Opener. This includes arranging a key and an alarm code. Also showing you how to open the space, how to announce when the space will be open, how to sign up new members, how to accept casual access fees, etc.

* **Step Five** - Back to the awesome making and voiding

# FAQ

## Can anyone become a member?
Anyone over 18 can become a Member.

## If I don't have a key, how often is the space open for me?
At the moment the space is open regularly nearly every Tuesday &amp; Wednesday evening, most Saturday afternoons, and many Sundays. Plus often at other times. If you join the [Makers mailing list](/mailman/listinfo/makers) then you’ll see posts when people plan to open the space, or when the space is open. See also the [calendar](/#calendar) for organised openings.

## Do I have to pay access for Maker Meetups?
No, but a donation would be appreciated.

## When do per visit use fees apply?
Members pay a per-visit casual use fee if they are working with tools (including their own, as this comes under our insurance) or using the facilities in the space. Social visits &amp; laptop use doesn’t require payment, but a donation would be appreciated.

## Do access fees apply if I'm helping another member with their project or running a workshop?
No. A donation would be appreciated.

## What about Makers under 18 (minors)?

Due to our insurance, only those 18 &amp; over may use tools at MHV.  Although they cannot become members, minors are welcome at Maker Meetups, or for social visits in the meeting area &amp; couches.

Those under 16 can visit the space when accompanied by a responsible adult who takes responsibility for their safety &amp; conduct.

There are no fees associated with minors coming to the space.

## I have another question.
You can email the MHV Treasurer - [treasurer@makehackvoid.com](mailto:treasurer@makehackvoid.com), email the MHV Secretary - [secretary@makehackvoid.com](mailto:secretary@makehackvoid.com), and/or email the [Makers Mailing list](/mailman/listinfo/makers/).
