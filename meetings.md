Maker Meetups
============

As a minimum, the MHV space is open every Tuesday evening from 6.30 for either a “Maker Meetup” (a semi-organised show and tell) or for a Community Meeting where members are free to discuss any relevant issues and raise items of interest.  

Visitors are welcome at any scheduled opening and members can always “do their own” thing in other areas of the space while meetings are underway.

Maker Meetups are a particularly good opportunity for visitors to check out the Makerspace, meet interesting people in Canberra’s Maker community and see the cool stuff people are working on.

If you have been working on something that you’d like to share, you’ll find plenty of people keen to hear about your progress and the challenges you've faced. You can bounce ideas around, compare notes or draw on collective experience and knowledge to help progress through tricky parts of your projects.

Everyone is welcome - all ages, interests and skill levels.

Workshops, special interest group meetings, hack-a-thons and project work by individuals or groups can happen anytime and are generally entered into the [MHV Google Calendar][1] and/or announced on [the forum][2] at least a few days before they happen.

Because the space is a workshop, you will need to wear covered shoes.

If you are unable to make it to our Maker Meetups, but wish to check out the space, keep an eye out for space openings and drop by some time.

You can check the calendar to see when people will be at space to show you around .
