MakeHackVoid is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form. People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any MakeHackVoid member.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, verbal or physical threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. People asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a person engages in harassing behaviour, MakeHackVoid members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the space or event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member or committee member immediately.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the [example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
