Concerned about the constant revelations of NSA surveillance that are turning up in your facebook timelines and twitter feeds? Worried about what your social media, email and other communication platforms of choice are doing with your data besides handing it over to foreign governments? However, not quite ready to turn your back on the internet just yet?

If you answered yes to any of these, or to none of these (what&rsquo;s the nsa?), then this is the (crypto)party for you. we&rsquo;ll be covering the basics on encryption and privacy tools to make sure that when you&rsquo;re traveling the interwebs from your own lounge room that you&rsquo;re not inviting in unwanted houseguests.

bring your laptop (recommended), bring a smile (mandatory), bring a gold coin donation for mhv (optional) and let&rsquo;s get this (crypto)party started!
