Had a great day at MHV today!

Lots of people came in and worked on a wide range of projects to improve MHV...

 * New content and pages were added to the MHV wiki
 * the new server is almost ready to use
 * new magazines added to a cleaned up bookshelf
 * clean toilets and tables
 * trial welding workshop conducted 
 * discussions about wooden framed electric bikes
 * a graph of number of unique rfid tags seen per day
 * robot banners sewn (not sure if they went up anywhere?)
 * new members joining up
 * working towards a new Flickr rotator and Facebook feed for the website
 * many other amazing things

Thanks to Patrick for bringing in sausages and Anton for cooking them for us.
